# ðŸ§  DIY ESP32 Sensor & Automation Framework

Welcome to the **ESP32 DIY Framework** â€” a beginner-friendly, open-source collection of ESPHome, Arduino, and Python examples for common sensors and automation projects. Itâ€™s designed to make learning, wiring, and testing easier than ever â€” with AI-assisted tips, real-world usage, and organized templates.

> ðŸ’¡ _If you ever get stuck: just ask ChatGPT. Or pull out your phone and say "how do I use a BMP390 with ESP32" â€” this repo will be the answer._

ðŸ™‹ About This Project

Most of whatâ€™s in this repo is just me learning as I go. I know there are guides and documentation out there â€” and Iâ€™ll use them when I really need to â€” but I prefer figuring things out with AI helping me along the way.

Everything here is shared in that spirit: it works for me, and maybe it'll work for you too. You're more than welcome to use it, try it, break it, fix it â€” whatever. And if youâ€™ve got suggestions or see a better way to do something, feel free to let me know.

This is just a living learning lab â€” powered by curiosity and a little chaos.
